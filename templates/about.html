			    		About Wurk Happy</h1>

			    	<h2 class="headline" style="font-family: museo_sans;margin-top:10px;">Wurk Happy is an online platform for freelancers and their clients that combines agreement, invoicing, and payment processing into one simple workflow.</h2>

			    	<h1 style="font-family:museo_sans;font-weight:700;margin:40px 0;">How do you make freelancing easier?</h1>
			    	<p>We started asking this question nearly 4 years ago. Freelancing is hard and it felt like there had to be a better way to work. We used to spend days crafting contracts that would become useless as soon as the client changed her mind about what kind of work she wanted. Knowing if my client and I had the same expectations about what work was to be done and how it was to be deemed complete was very important, especially when it was time to invoice - yet it was also very time consuming. Billing was never straightfoward. Different clients have different ways to pay. There just wasn't a standard that was incredibly easy.</p>

			    	<p>From these frustrations and the insight of hundreds of freelancers, Wurk Happy was slowly born. From the beginning we set out to build a better process rather than just another tool. In fact, we aimed to be the only real business workflow a freelancer needs - ultra simple to start using yet powerful enough to cater to all freelance situations.</p>

			    	<p>If you're like us, you crave simplicity. I didn’t appreciate the tools that were out there. I didn’t want to use excel, word, an invoicing app, a payment app, and a project management app just to manage my relationship with my client. I justed wanted things to feel simple - so I could enjoy those occasional zen moments that happen in the flow of great work. I also didn’t want to live in software. I wanted software that was there when I needed it to be and invisible when I didn't need it.</p>

			    	<p>As the process came together - agreement, communication, invoicing, and payment, we found that we could make each individual component feel simpler to use because it's part of a process that we guide the freelancer and client through. 

			    	<p>We've come a long way in making the a better way to freelance - and we're humbled to be at a point where freelancers really appreicate the work we've put in. But we have a long way to go. Everyday we make Wurk Happy better. We're focused on providing the best service we can.</p>

			    	<p>If you ever have any suggestions, please <a style="color: hsl(38, 100%, 50%);text-transform:lowercase;" href="mailto:contact@wurkhappy.com">reach out to us</a>. We would love to hear from you.</p>

			    	<h1 style="font-family:museo_sans;font-weight:700;margin-bottom:40px;">Who is behind this?</h1>

			  	<!-- <h1 style="font-family:museo_sans;font-weight:700;margin-bottom:40px;">We believe.</h1>


			    <h2 style="color:white;margin-bottom:10px;">Freelancing is the future of business</h2>
			    <p>Technology is creating opportunities that have never existed. We have seen a shift towards remote working and flexible hours but this is just a start. Through technology, we believe we can empower individuals to have the freedom to choose their lifestyles.</p>

			    <h2 style="color:white;margin-bottom:10px;">Good relationships are the key to good business</h2>
			    <p>Freelancing is no different than any other business. For as long as people have been transacting goods and services, relationships have been at the core of those transactions. New buzzwords and theories may come in and out of fashion but good business will always mean good relationships.</p>

			    <h2 style="color:white;margin-bottom:10px;">Our job is to remove obstacles that stand between you and your client</h2>
			    <p>Freelancing can be hard. As a freelancer, you are a one-person business. This means managing many different tasks. Those tasks while necessary distract you from producing your best work and building a relationship with your client. Let us take care of anything that stops you from achieveing either or those two things.</p> -->
